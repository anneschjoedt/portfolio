    "In my work designing user interfaces, I emphasize on creating an efficient and intuitive design. Since I myself have worked with frontend development on various projects, I always try to keep the development part in mind when I design. In this way, the handover to the developer is as easy and smooth as possible - and the design becomes a reality.",
